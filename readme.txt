Source code

The code was compiled under Tiny C Compiler.
But you can compile it with any modern C compiler.
The source code can be compiled for a wide range of operating systems, but you need to create a makefile or a build script by yourself.
I provide only two things: the binary file for Windows and the makefile for Linux.

Install and uninstall under Linux

Follow these steps:

1. Extract the content of the source code archive.
2. Open a terminal and go to the source code directory.
